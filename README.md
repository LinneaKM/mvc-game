# Dice assignment

This assignment is part of the course object-oriented web technologies (mvc) at Blekinge Institute of Technology. In this assignment you had to create a game of 21. A human player plays against the computer. The player (and computer) must roll one or two dice and try to get as close to 21 as possible, but they must not go over. Whoever comes closest to 21 wins. In case of a tie, the computer wins.

# Yatzy assignment

This is the second assignment in the course object-oriented web technologies (mvc) at Blekinge Institute of Technology. Here the focus was to build a controller. In this assignment you had to create a simple Yatzy game. The game is about collecting as many of the same dice face and thus get as many points as possible. The player has five dice and three strokes each round. After three strokes, the player places his/hers points in either aces, twos, threes, fours, fives or sixes depending on which dice face the player collected.
