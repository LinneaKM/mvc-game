# Dice assignment

This assignment is part of the course object-oriented web technologies (mvc) at Blekinge Institute of Technology. In this assignment you had to create a game of 21. A human player plays against the computer. The player (and computer) must roll one or two dice and try to get as close to 21 as possible, but they must not go over. Whoever comes closest to 21 wins. In case of a tie, the computer wins.
